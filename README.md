# PySpark logistic regression

To simulate Big Data workflow I installed a VM on my local computer, Spark and configured PySpark to work with Jupyter Notebook. For different setup scenarios, check the course [Spark and Python for Big Data with PySpark](https://www.udemy.com/course/spark-and-python-for-big-data-with-pyspark/).  

## Dataset
